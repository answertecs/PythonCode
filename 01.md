# Python Keywords
Keywords are special words which are reserved and have a specific meaning. Python has a set of keywords that cannot be used as variables in programs.

All keywords in Python are case sensitive. So, you must be careful while using them in your code. We’ve just captured here a snapshot of the possible Python keywords.


```
$> python                                                         
>>> help()
help> keywords

Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.

and                 elif                if                  print
as                  else                import              raise
assert              except              in                  return
break               exec                is                  try
class               finally             lambda              while
continue            for                 not                 with
def                 from                or                  yield
del                 global              pass
````

It’s a long list to remember all at once. Our purpose of mentioning it here is only to give you an initial idea of the available keywords. However, we’ll cover each of them in the rest of the tutorials. You don’t need to jump onto memorizing them instead try to learn to use them step by step.


# Python Identifiers
Python Identifiers are user-defined names to represent a variable, function, class, module or any other object. If you assign some name to a programmable entity in Python, then it is nothing but technically called an identifier.

Python language lays down a set of rules for programmers to create meaningful identifiers.

#### Guidelines for Creating Identifiers in Python.
1. To form an identifier, use a sequence of letters either in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z). However, you can also mix up digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_) while writing an identifier.
    
        For example – Names like shapeClass, shape_1, and upload_shape_to_db are all valid identifiers.

2. You can’t use digits to begin an identifier name. It’ll lead to the syntax error.

        For example – The name, 0Shape is incorrect, but shape1 is a valid identifier.

3. Also, the Keywords are reserved, so you should not use them as identifiers.

    ```
    >>> for=1
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    >>> True=1
    SyntaxError: can't assign to keyword
    ```
4. Python Identifiers can also not have special characters `[‘.’, ‘!’, ‘@’, ‘#’, ‘$’, ‘%’]` in their formation. These symbols are forbidden.

    ```
    >>> @index=0
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    >>> isPython?=True
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    ```


# Python Variables
A variable in Python represents an entity whose value can change as and when required. Conceptually, it is a memory location which holds the actual value. And we can retrieve the value from our code by querying the entity.

But it requires assigning a label to that memory location so that we can reference it. And we call it as a variable in the programming terms.

Following are some of the key facts about Python variables. These will help programmers to use them efficiently.

1. Variables don’t require declaration. However, you must initialize them before use.

    ```
    test = 10
    ```
2. The above expression will lead to the following actions.
    
    * Creation of an object to represent the value 10.
    * If the variable (test) doesn’t exist, then it’ll get created.
    * Association of the variable with the object, so that it can refer the value.
    * The variable ‘test’ is a reference to the value ’10’. 

3. Whenever the expression changes, Python associates a new object (a chunk of memory) to the variable for referencing that value. And the old one goes to the garbage collector.

    ```
    >>> test = 10
    >>> id(test)
    1716585200
    >>> test = 11
    >>> id(test)
    1716585232
    >>>
    ```
4. Also, for optimization, Python builds a cache and reuses some of the immutable objects, such as small integers and strings.
5. An object is just a region of memory which can hold the following.
    * The actual object values.
    * A type designator to reflect the object type.
    * The reference counter which determines when it’s OK to reclaim the object.
6. It’s the object which has a type, not the variable. However, a variable can hold objects of different types as and when required.

    ```
    >>> test = 10
    >>> type(test)
    <class 'int'>
    >>> test = 'techbeamers'
    >>> type(test)
    <class 'str'>
    >>> test = {'Python', 'C', 'C++'}
    >>> type(test)
    <class 'set'>
    >>>
    ```
